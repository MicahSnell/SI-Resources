# Run Instructions
Now you can run the program in three different output modes by using different command line arguments.
1. Type
```bash
./a.out -s
```
and the program will output the loop number and every value/index that is swapped in each pass.  
2. Type
```bash
./a.out -a
```
and the program will output the loop number and the sorted elements in the array after each pass.  
3. Type
```bash
./a.out -v
```
and the program will output the loop number and the output from both 1 and 2 together.
