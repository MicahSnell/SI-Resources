# Run Instructions
Now you can run the program in three different output modes by using different command line arguments.
1. Type
```bash
./a.out -s
```
and the program will output the loop number and every value/index that is swapped in each pass of the for loop.

2. Type 
```bash
./a.out -a
```
and the program will output the loop number and the entire array after each pass of the do-while loop.

3. Type
```bash
./a.out -v
```
and the program will output the loop number and the output from both 1. and 2. together.
